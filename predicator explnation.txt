🔍 Predictor Input Headings Explained
1. Job Title

👉 Example: Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer
💬 Meaning:
The role or position for which the salary is being predicted.
Different roles have different pay scales — e.g., Data Scientist > Data Analyst > Intern.

📊 Why it matters:
It’s the strongest indicator of salary because it defines the job level and skill depth.

2. Sector / Industry

👉 Example: Business Intelligence, IT, Research, Finance, Health, Retail
💬 Meaning:
The industry or business area the job belongs to.
For instance, a Data Analyst in Finance earns differently from one in Education.

📊 Why it matters:
Each sector has its own average pay depending on market demand and company budgets.

3. Company Rating

👉 Example: 4.2, 3.9, 4.7
💬 Meaning:
This is usually the Glassdoor rating of the company (from 0–5), based on employee satisfaction and reputation.

📊 Why it matters:
Companies with higher ratings often offer better salaries and work benefits.
It reflects company prestige — a factor influencing pay.

4. Skills

👉 Example: Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Machine Learning
💬 Meaning:
Key skills listed in job descriptions.
The richer and more in-demand your skills, the higher your expected salary.

📊 Why it matters:
A job requiring Python + SQL + ML typically pays more than one needing just Excel.

5. Location

👉 Example: Bangalore, New York, Pune, California, London
💬 Meaning:
The city or state where the job is located.
Cost of living and demand vary greatly by geography.

📊 Why it matters:
Data Analysts in metro cities or tech hubs earn higher than those in smaller regions.
E.g., Bangalore > Jaipur or San Francisco > Austin.

⚙️ Behind the Scenes — Model Logic

In the backend, the model uses “Sector” and “Rating” as primary training features because:

“Sector” (industry) → categorical impact on salary.

“Rating” → numerical impact (higher rating = higher pay).

You can later enhance this by including Job_Title and Location in the ML model if you want it to be more accurate — I can show you how to do that next.
